# A-Pathfinding-Script
This project implements the A* (A-star) algorithm in Python to efficiently find the shortest path between two points on a grid. The algorithm effectively combines Dijkstra's algorithm and the Greedy Best-First Search approach, making it optimal for pathfinding tasks
Key Features:
    Grid-based pathfinding with customizable obstacles.
    Uses Manhattan distance as the heuristic for optimal path calculation.
    Dynamic user input for starting and ending coordinates.
    Provides clear output with successful path visualization.
    Includes detailed comments for improved code readability.

Technologies Used:
    Python
    Heapq for priority queue management

How to Run:
    Clone the repository.
    Install Python 3.x if not already installed.
    Run the script using python A_star_algorithm.py.
    Follow the prompts to enter the starting and ending points.

Future Improvements:
    Support for diagonal movement.
    Visual representation of the grid and path.
    Dynamic grid resizing and customization.
